configuration is possible by editing the standard NTP configuration file (/etc/ntp.conf) for Linux NTP utilities.

package managers 

Dabian - apkg installer  via apt
Red hat  RPM -  openSUSE, Mandriva, CentOS, Oracle Linux  . ---- yum (Yellowdog Updater, Modified - the package manager used by Fedora and Red Hat Enterprise Linux),

Before openSUSE 13.1, Apper was used for Software Management.

 Now it has been replaced by the YaST (Yet another System Tool)

The man pages are often converted to:

Web pages
Published books
Graphical help
Other formats
The man pages are divided into nine numbered chapters (1 through 9). 
n	Go to the next node
p	Go to the previous node
u	Move one node up in the index

 df -Th (disk-free) 

Network files ->sudo service nfs start

Mout to server --> $ mount servername:/projects /mnt/nfs/projects

Certain filesystems like the one mounted at /proc are called pseudo filesystems because they have no permanent presence anywhere on disk.

/proc filesystem contains vertual file systems


/etc/fstab auomatically mounts


Commands that are not essential for the system in single-user mode are placed in the /usr/bin directory, while the /sbin directory is used for essential binaries related to system administration, such as ifconfig and shutdown. There is also a /usr/sbin directory for less essential system administration programs.


rsync is a very powerful utility. For example, a very useful way to back up a project directory might be to use the following command:

$ rsync -r project-X archive-machine:archives/project-X

Add new User --> $ sudo useradd turkey

Note that for openSUSE, useradd is not in the normal user's PATH so the command should be:

$ sudo /usr/sbin/useradd turkey


Delete ---> userdel turkey

Adding a new group is done with groupadd:

$ sudo /usr/sbin/groupadd anewgroup

The group can be removed with

$ sudo /usr/sbin/groupdel anewgroup


and then add the new group:

$ sudo /usr/sbin/usermod -G anewgroup turkey
$ groups turkey
turkey: turkey anewgroup

Removing a user from the group is a somewhat trickier. The -G option to usermod must give a complete list of groups. Thus if you do:

$ sudo /usr/sbin/usermod -G turkey turkey
$ groups turkey
turkey : turkey
